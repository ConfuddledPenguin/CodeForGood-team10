CodeForGood-team10
==================

###Description##

Created for J.P.Morgans Code for Good event. This is the Musoni project, in which we are to implement a system that allows the user to give informaton on a client's loan application, and using a database of historical informaiton on clients, loans and other data, determine whether or not to approve the loan. This has been done in Java.

This was everyones in the groups first large hackathon event, so while we did not achieve much it was a great learning experiance in both new ideas and technologies but in also working on things in a short peroid of time.
